# Note Taker 
Challenge 11 for UoM Express.js Note Taker:  

For this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating an application that can be used to write notes and save them for later. Using express.js backend and a JSON file to retrieve and save said data. 

- The motivation behind this project was to become more familiar with using express.js and creating Get,Post and Delete request handling.  
 
- I built this project to advance my skills with working with node.js and learning how to use express.js.   

- This project resolves around having a user create, save and delete notes that then update the JSON file. Using express.js we can use different routes to achieve this. 

- Completion of this project allowed for me to become more knowledgeable with node.js and working with express.js.
